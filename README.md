# OAuth vs JWT

## What is authentication?

```
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or a client.
It usually involves providing some credentials, such as a username and password, or a token, that prove who you are.
Authentication ensures that only authorized parties can access protected resources, such as APIs, databases, or web pages.

```

## What is authorization?

```
Authorization is the process of granting or denying access to specific resources based on the authenticated identity.
It usually involves checking some permissions, roles, or scopes, that define what you can do with the resources.
Authorization ensures that only authorized actions can be performed on protected resources, such as reading, writing, or deleting data.
